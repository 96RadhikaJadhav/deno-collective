# Adding Your Project

Simply edit this `README.md`, adding your project to one, or both of the lists and make a pull request!

If your project is looking for contributors, then you can edit the following markdown:
```
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>)
```
If your project has good first issues for newcomers, then you can edit the following markdown:
```
[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
```

An example pull request change would look like so:
```
* ... existing project listed

    ... badge for the project above
